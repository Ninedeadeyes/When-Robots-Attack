# When-Robots-Attack

A simple JavaScript Shooter in less than 250 lines of JavaScript Code. 

To play the game

My main purpose of the project was to learn how to modularise and use OOP(Class) in JavaScript but I also wanted to create a game that was 'real time' as all previous JavaScript games have been turn based.   
.  

-All music written with Beepbox.

-All sound effects from freesound.org

-All Graphics created from GraphicsGale

My version contain additional features such as

1) My own artwork and music
2) Score system, see different 'reports' as you progress through the game 
3) Differculty progression, the more you score the harder it gets. ( Both speed and amount of enemies) 
4) two differculty options depending if you are using mouse or touch screen ( implementation of OOP ) 
5) Muliple lives with a text/visual display (warning message/forcefield) to represent it
6) Game over music and 'death' screen. 
7) Modularise some Javascript code relating to audio and 'data'( info).
8) General Refactoring including updated ES features like Arrow Functions, queryselector (),Template strings , Ternary Operator.
